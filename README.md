# Followed YouTube series: Neovim from Scratch

This neovim configuration is being build up incrementally from scratch on a video series on my [YouTube channel: MrJakob](https://youtube.com/c/MrJakob).

You may use this configuration as an inspiration to create youre own. Follow the [Video Series](https://youtu.be/g1gyYttzxcI?si=zTQLkcXjYp0pdVTE) to get a better understanding of where to start when rolling a Neovim configuration from scratch.
